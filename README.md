Simulation of a gas of Hard Disks using Julia and PyPlot
============================================================================


The aim of this project is to implement the use of Data Structures in the simulation of a gas of Hard Disks. Particularly, the use of the PriorityQueues type from the Collections module. For this project was particularly useful the approach given by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne in their books *Algorithms* and *Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures* -see [this](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr07/cos226/lectures/06PriorityQueues.pdf)
for a summary -.

To run the simulation, execute **run.jl**. If you want to play with the input parameters modify the file **input_parameters.jl** .
