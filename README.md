Creating billiard systems with Julia Lang
=====================================

The purpose of this project is to design billiard-like simulations using Julia programming language and matplotlib (Pyplot)
as the visualization tool. Since I liked to start with the Lorentz gas system, the file is called *LorentzGasJulia*, but I
started with simulating the Hard Disks gas.

The aim of this project is to implement the use of Data Structures in the simulations. Particularly, the use of the PriorityQueues
type from the Collections module. For this project was particularly useful the approach given by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne
in their books *Algorithms* and *Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures* -see [this](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr07/cos226/lectures/06PriorityQueues.pdf)
for a summary -.

To run the simulation, execute **run.jl**. If you want to play with the input parameters modify the file **input_parameters.jl** .
